Who's pitching to the Home Run Derby participants?
What is the format for this year's Home Run Derby?
There are three rounds to the eight-player Derby: first round, semifinals and finals.
In the first round, the eight players each have three minutes or 40 pitches (whichever comes first) to hit as many homers as possible. There is also a bonus period for each player that lasts until they record three outs (any swing that doesn't result in a home run) within the period. If a player hits a home run of at least 425 feet within the bonus period, the period is extended until the player records a fourth out.
The players with the top four homer totals advance to the semis. In the event of a first-round tie, the player who hit the longest home run during the round advances.

In the semifinals, the format shifts to "knockout style," with No. 1 vs. No. 4 and No. 2 vs. No. 3. The seeds are determined solely by the number of home runs each player hit in the first round. Players will have two minutes or 27 pitches in the semifinals and finals, and home run totals from the first round don't carry over.
Ties in the semifinals or finals are broken by successive three-swing “swing-offs” until there is a winner.
The winners of the two semifinal matchups advance to the finals, where the limits are reduced to two minutes and 27 pitches. The player with the most home runs after that period is crowned Home Run Derby champion.
One final note: Each batter is entitled to one 45-second timeout in each of the three regulation periods, but timeouts can't be called during the bonus periods or tiebreakers.
Has Atlanta previously hosted the Home Run Derby?
Yes, once before. The All-Star Game took place at Atlanta's Turner Field in 2000. That year's eight-player Derby field featured five future Hall of Famers: Ken Griffey Jr., Edgar Martinez, Vladimir Guerrero Sr., Ivan Rodriguez and hometown favorite Chipper Jones.
Griffey was going for a three-peat and
a fourth Derby title
, but he was defeated in the finals by Sammy Sosa, nine homers to two. Sosa crushed 26 dingers during the event. Griffey had the second-highest total with 11.
Derby history: Looking back at past slugfests
What happened in last year's Derby?
There were 225 homers hit during the 2024 Home Run Derby at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas. Those dingers traveled a combined distance of 92,590 feet, or roughly 17 1/2 miles.
The Royals' Bobby Witt Jr. hit the most home runs among the eight participants (50),
but he was bested in the finals by the Dodgers' Teoscar Hernández, 14-13

Selections made in the top 10 rounds have bonus-slot values assigned to each spot, leading to each club’s collective bonus pool. The overage on any bonus signed above $150,000 after the 10th round will also be applied to the pool. So the middle rounds are where teams get creative – sometimes mixing senior signs with low leverage with high-ceiling prep types who need to be signed away from major college commitments. Players taken in the top 10 rounds often sign because teams lose that slot value in their pool if they can’t complete a deal.
There will be one-minute breaks between picks through Round 10 on Monday, as well as a 10-minute break between Rounds 6 and 7. There will be no delay between selections after that, beyond a one-hour break between Rounds 10 and 11 and another 10-minute pause between Rounds 15 and 16.
Below is a running breakdown of some of the most notable picks from Day 2, along with their rank on the
MLB Pipeline Top 250 Draft rankings
