In the
MLB Draft,
good things can come for those who wait. So while much of the hype is about the high-profile prospects who hear their names called near the top of the first round, there are plenty of potential stars who have to wait.
Sometimes they even have to wait all the way to
Day 2 of the Draft, which will be held on Monday
, featuring the final 17 rounds (4-20). No, the depth of future MLB talent is not the same in this range as it is earlier in the Draft, but every year, teams uncover hidden gems.
With that in mind, here is a look at the most productive players -- by Baseball Reference's
wins above replacement (WAR)
-- ever selected in each double-digit round, up to Round 20, counting only picks who signed. We'll also touch on some of the top players taken after the 20th round, before the Draft was scaled back to its current size.
Round 10: Howie Kendrick, Angels, 2002, 35.0 WAR
Kendrick went on to hit .294 while banging out more than 1,700 hits over 15 big league seasons, including nine with the Angels. He earned an All-Star selection for the club in 2011 and was a postseason hero (and NLCS MVP) for the World Series champion 2019 Nationals.
Honorable mentions:
Brady Anderson, Red Sox, 1985; Mike Sweeney, Royals, 1991; Vince Coleman, Cardinals, 1982
Most notable active players:

Round 11: Andre Dawson, Expos, 1975, 64.9 WAR
The Hawk was the 1977 NL Rookie of the Year with Montreal and the '87 NL MVP with the Cubs, collecting 438 homers and eight Gold Gloves during a Hall of Fame career.

Round 12: Nolan Ryan, Mets, 1965, 81.3 WAR

600 home runs
-- with Aaron the only other one to hit 700 homers.

He was a big part of the great A's teams of the late 1980s, taking AL Rookie of the Year honors in '86 and MVP honors in '88, when he became baseball's first 40-40 man.

John Smoltz, Tigers, 1985 (22nd round), 69.0 WAR
Shipped to the Braves as a prospect, Smoltz became a Cy Young Award winner and Hall of Famer, making All-Star teams as both a starter and a closer. He's the only pitcher to record 200 wins and 100 saves.
Keith Hernandez, Cardinals, 1971 (42nd round), 60.3 WAR
The slick-fielding first baseman made it from the high school ranks to St. Louis in just three years and developed into the 1979 NL co-MVP. Hernandez collected nearly 2,200 hits in a 17-year-career, captured 11 Gold Glove Awards and won World Series rings with the '82 Cardinals and '86 Mets.
Andy Pettitte, Yankees, 1990 (22nd round), 60.2 WAR
Selected out of a Texas high school, Pettitte wound up starting more than 500 Major League games -- and that was just in the regular season. He also won five World Series titles with the Yankees and is the all-time postseason leader in starts (44), innings (276 2/3) and wins (19).
Mark Buehrle, White Sox, 1998 (38th round), 59.3 WAR
The lefty was a terrific find for the Sox with the 1,139th pick out of a Missouri junior college. From 2001-15, he logged at least 30 starts and 10 wins every year while producing a 116 ERA+.
Honorable mentions:
Roy Oswalt, Astros, 1996 (23rd round); Mark Grace, Cubs, 1985 (24th round); Jorge Posada, Yankees, 1990 (24th round); Dusty Baker, Braves, 1967, (26th round); Ken Griffey Sr., Reds, 1969 (29th round); Kevin Kiermaier, Rays, 2010 (31st round); Kenny Rogers, Rangers, 1982 (39th round)

Selections made in the top 10 rounds have bonus-slot values assigned to each spot, leading to each club’s collective bonus pool. The overage on any bonus signed above $150,000 after the 10th round will also be applied to the pool. So the middle rounds are where teams get creative – sometimes mixing senior signs with low leverage with high-ceiling prep types who need to be signed away from major college commitments. Players taken in the top 10 rounds often sign because teams lose that slot value in their pool if they can’t complete a deal.
There will be one-minute breaks between picks through Round 10 on Monday, as well as a 10-minute break between Rounds 6 and 7. There will be no delay between selections after that, beyond a one-hour break between Rounds 10 and 11 and another 10-minute pause between Rounds 15 and 16.
Below is a running breakdown of some of the most notable picks from Day 2, along with their rank on the
