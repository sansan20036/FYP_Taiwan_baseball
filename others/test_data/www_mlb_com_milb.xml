Baseball camp for the deaf fulfills dreams -- starting with the founder's
This year, dozens of local deaf youth turned out for the I-Cubs' Deaf Culture Night -- the Triple-A club's benefit for the Iowa Baseball Camp for the Deaf.

Thunder and lightning are nothing new around the ballpark. In fact, in some parts of the country, summer thunderstorms are quite common.
