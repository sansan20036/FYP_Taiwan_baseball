DENVER – Ethan Holliday was almost 8 months old when his father, Matt Holliday, and his big brother, Jackson – then 4 years old but aware – were on the infield at Coors Field celebrating the Rockies’ qualification for the 2007 World Series.
The family ties between the Hollidays and the Rockies grew even tighter on Sunday.
The Rockies selected Ethan Holliday, a 6-foot-4, 210-pound infielder from Stillwater (Okla.) High School -- and according to MLB Pipeline, the
No. 1 overall Draft prospect
-- in the fourth overall spot in the 2025 MLB Draft.

“I had a little bit of a feeling as the days started trickling down – there was a little something inside me that was kind of leaning towards the Rockies,” Ethan Holliday said. “And my mom [Leslee Holliday] said she had a feeling, too.
“We're so juiced and so excited for this opportunity, and it's pretty incredible.”
There was some nail-biting, with corners of the baseball world wondering if the Nationals would select Holliday first overall. But Washington, under recently hired general manager Mike DeBartolo, took Eli Willits – a different Oklahoma high school shortstop, from Fort Cobb-Broxton High School. Picking Willits, 17, potentially allows the Nats to distribute bonus money widely.

The next two picks were collegiate pitchers. UC Santa Barbara righty Tyler Bremner went to the Angels, and LSU lefty Kade Anderson went to the Mariners. The Rockies felt their man would be there at No. 4.
Should Holliday display what MLB Pipeline calls “the most usable left-handed power in the Draft,” it'll deepen what has been a tremendous franchise-family tie.

Is expectation attached to the family name? Yes.
But it’s all good.
“I wouldn't sit here and say it's all been easy, but also, I'm so blessed to be able to play baseball,” Ethan said during his MLB Network interview. “If the hardest thing in my life is expectations and pressure, then I'm going to wake up super-grateful every single day.
“And the people that pour into my life, the people that are supporting me, that's one of the main reasons why I can do what I love, is with freedom in my mind.”
The link started even before the Rockies drafted Matt Holliday, who represented the team in three All-Star Games and ranks eighth in Rockies history in
WAR
according to Baseball Reference.
Holliday on Holliday: 2022's No. 1 pick gives scouting report on '25 Draft pick brother
Dave Holliday had already begun a 19-year career in scouting and front-office jobs with the Rockies. Before the 1998 Draft, Matt Holliday – known as much or more as a high school football quarterback for Stillwater High – committed to Oklahoma State for football but would play baseball for his father, Tom Holliday.
Teams avoided Matt, believing his football commitment and the lure of playing baseball for his father would cost too much to get him to sign. As the Draft moved toward the seventh round, then-Rockies scouting director Pat Daugherty got a commitment from ownership for $840,000 (more than some first-rounders). Then Daugherty called Dave, who called Tom. Matt signed as the 210th overall pick.
Matt Holliday became a star over five seasons with the Rockies before being dealt to the Athletics for a haul that included future Rockies stars Carlos González and Huston Street. Holliday returned in 2018 to finish his career with the last Colorado team to go to the postseason. While Holliday played more seasons with the Cardinals and went to four All-Star Games, Rockies fans will fight tooth and nail to claim him as part of their glory.
Not long after the pick, the Rockies posted on social media pictures of Matt holding his infant son (in a big, bucket hat), and Ethan toddling around in Purple Pinstripes.
“The organization has a special place in my heart, in our family's heart, and our lives,” said Matt Holliday, who said that he would be there to help if the Rockies asked, as he did with Jackson with the Orioles. “And it's a cool story. It's exciting for him and the organization.

“This year is obviously not going great, but it doesn't take much to get things like this turned around.”
The Rockies weren't able to nab Jackson Holliday, whom the Orioles grabbed with the
No. 1 overall pick
in the 2022 Draft.
On Sunday, they welcomed Ethan Holliday to the family.
The father-son similarities are difficult to ignore.
While the Orioles’ Jackson Holliday is playing second base and has the build for it at around 6 feet and well under 200 pounds, his physical similarity to Matt is the curly hair (which Matt had when drafted, at least).

Highlights
"The raw power is stupid,” senior director of scouting operations Marc Gustafson said. “I've not scouted a high schooler that's ever displayed that type of power to all fields, with his body at 6-foot-4 and the muscles that are about to come.”
Ethan, who also has those boyish locks, and Matt are both listed at 6-4. Matt was selected as a third baseman, but the Rockies felt a burly frame that would reach 240 pounds was better suited to the outfield.
In his senior year at Stillwater, Ethan hit .617 with a 1.309 slugging percentage and 16 home runs in 32 games.
While Ethan primarily played shortstop in high school (he played third base during the 2022 season, when he shared the left side of the infield with Jackson), his size probably makes him a better candidate for the hot corner at the professional level. He has average speed and a solid throwing arm, making him a potentially above-average defender at third.
The Rockies have 2024 Gold Glove shortstop Ezequiel Tovar signed through 2030 with a club option for 2031, but Sunday they said Holliday will start his pro career at shortstop and make decisions as his career progresses.
“He'll find his way off if he does,” vice president and assistant general manager of scouting Danny Montgomery said. “But right now, our plan is not to take this kid off short and let him see what we got with him at that position."
Ethan, by the way, is committed to Oklahoma State's baseball program – now coached by his uncle, Josh Holliday. But at this Draft position, he's almost certain to sign.
Either way, he stays in the family.

Selections made in the top 10 rounds have bonus-slot values assigned to each spot, leading to each club’s collective bonus pool. The overage on any bonus signed above $150,000 after the 10th round will also be applied to the pool. So the middle rounds are where teams get creative – sometimes mixing senior signs with low leverage with high-ceiling prep types who need to be signed away from major college commitments. Players taken in the top 10 rounds often sign because teams lose that slot value in their pool if they can’t complete a deal.
There will be one-minute breaks between picks through Round 10 on Monday, as well as a 10-minute break between Rounds 6 and 7. There will be no delay between selections after that, beyond a one-hour break between Rounds 10 and 11 and another 10-minute pause between Rounds 15 and 16.
Below is a running breakdown of some of the most notable picks from Day 2, along with their rank on the
MLB Pipeline Top 250 Draft rankings
