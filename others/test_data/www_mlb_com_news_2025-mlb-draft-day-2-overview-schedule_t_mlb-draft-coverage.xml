Day 1 of the 2025 Draft lasted a little longer than usual, going from
Oklahoma prep shortstop Eli Willits at No. 1
to the Nationals to Nate Snead at No. 105 to the Angels as a compensation selection.
Day 2 is going to be even busier.
Rounds 4-20 arrive Monday in Atlanta as part of All-Star Week festivities, thus wrapping up this year’s edition of the First-Year Player Draft. In total, 26 of MLB Pipeline’s Top 100 Draft prospects remain on the board and could hear their names called as teams balance upside and value through the rest of the process.

How to watch and when
Round 4 of the Draft begins at 11:30 a.m. ET from Atlanta. The entire second day will be broadcast and streamed on MLB.com until the process is wrapped up after Round 20.
There will be one minute between picks for Rounds 4-10 and a 10-minute break between Rounds 6 and 7. There will also be a one-hour break between Rounds 10 and 11 and then no delay between selections after that (beyond another 10-minute pause after Round 15).
Top prospects remaining
Below are quick scouting reports on the highest-ranked prospects still remaining from MLB Pipeline's
Top 250 Draft Prospects list
. Players taken in the top 10 rounds often sign because teams would otherwise lose the slot bonus from their pool. Highly ranked high schoolers who last beyond Round 10 often head to college.
In the past, the third round (i.e., the first round of Day 2) has been when teams have sought over-slot deals with prep players after taking the night to assess their options. That could be the case for Round 4 under the new two-day format, and that's something to consider for the names here.
Mason Neville, OF, Oregon (
No. 35
)
After going deep 16 times as a sophomore in 2024, Neville broke out with 26 roundtrippers this spring, tying him at the top of the Division I leaderboard in the category. He cut down on some of his swing-and-miss in ’25 but still struggled against non-fastballs, and that could be what has kept him available until the fourth round. With above-average speed and arm strength, he could get center-field looks at the next level.
Jack Bauer, LHP, Lincoln-Way East (Ill.) HS (
No. 44
)
Sure, he’s known for having the
same name as the
24
character
. But the 6-foot-3 left-hander also caught plenty of nationwide attention for
touching 103 mph on the mound
in June. Bauer’s top-end velo is some of the best in the class, but he doesn’t always command the heater as well as he should. His high-spin slider is his best secondary. Bauer is committed to Mississippi State.
Matthew Fisher, RHP, Memorial (Ind.) HS (
No. 46
)
Named the Gatorade High School Player of the Year for the Hoosier State, the 6-foot-3 right-hander has three above-average pitches in his 92-93 mph fastball, low-80s slider and upper-70s curveball, though he didn’t always show consistent velo as a prepster. Much will come down to him adding strength to that frame as he matures physically. Fisher is committed to Indiana.
Alec Blair, OF, De La Salle (Calif.) HS (
No. 52
)
Blair has a commitment to play both basketball and baseball at Oklahoma, so it might be tough to talk him out of heading to Norman. But if any team can on Day 2, they’ll be getting a 6-foot-6 outfielder with above-average power, speed and arm strength. His left-handed swing can get long, but there’s every possibility that could get ironed out if he turns his focus full time to the diamond.

Cameron Appenzeller, LHP, Glenwood (Ill.) HS (
No. 58
)
Another Illinois prep arm remains from the state that produced Top 100 prospects Noah Schultz and Ryan Sloan (among others) in recent years. Appenzeller already stands 6-foot-6, and scouts should be hopeful that he could fill out more and add to his fastball velo after that fell to the 84-89 mph range this spring. His upper-70s slider and low-80s changeup give the Tennessee commit two more weapons he’ll take either to the pros or the Volunteers.
Brock Sell, OF, Tokay (Calif.) HS (
No. 65
)
On his Top 250 list player page, Sell was mentioned as a potential tough sign due to his Stanford commitment, so that could be playing out here. He’s a left-handed batter with a quick swing that can catch up to velocity, like a 100 mph fastball from No. 6 overall pick Seth Hernandez in a showcase last summer. He’s also a plus runner, but there are questions about his future power.

Briggs McKenzie, LHP, Corinth Holders (N.C.) HS (
No. 69
)
MacKenzie Gore rode a special curveball to the third overall pick in 2017. McKenzie -- also a North Carolina southpaw -- is still waiting to hear his name called, but his 75-78 mph breaker already looks like a plus offering with some room to grow with more advanced instruction. He didn’t quite hold his velocity all spring, often operating 87-91 mph, and that could be something he works on if he heads to LSU.
Zach Strickland, RHP, Maranatha (Calif.) HS (
No. 71
)
Some scouts have said the 6-foot-2 right-hander has an “angry heater” since it sits in the 92-94 mph range with plenty of life. He works off that with an upper-70s slider and a low-80s change that could both be future 55-grade pitches, while his curveball lags behind the other three offerings. The UCLA commit can land that repertoire for strikes already too, which boosted his pre-Draft stock.
Henry Ford, 1B/OF, Virginia (
No. 73
)
A Draft-eligible sophomore, Ford has already announced his plans to transfer to Tennessee following the Cavaliers' coaching change. He caught plenty of attention for hitting 17 homers as a freshman in 2024 but that total dipped to 11 this spring. The 6-foot-5 right-handed hitter still has the frame to bring pop, especially if he can get back to elevating on contact, and he looked playable in the outfield after moving there both in Charlottesville and on the Cape.
Gavin Turley, OF, Oregon State (
No. 78
)
Turley has some of the best raw power in the class, earning plus-plus grades from some scouts, and he has the bat speed to back it up. He improved some of his contact rates this spring with the Beavers, but those concerns are still fairly loud for the right-handed slugger. He has the above-average speed and plus arm to be an asset in the outfield too, and could be five-tool star if the hit tool improves.

Rounds 4-20 will use the following order:
1. White Sox
2. Rockies
3. Marlins

Bonus pool &amp; slot value
All picks made in the top 10 rounds come with an assigned bonus-slot value. Those values are compiled to total each organization's bonus pool. The overage on any bonus higher than $150,000 after the 10th round will also be applied to the pool.
The Orioles, who have 14 picks in the top 10 rounds, own the largest bonus pool ($19,144,500). That's the highest allotment since the pool bonus-pool era began in 2012.
Each selection in the first 10 rounds comes with an assigned slot value. For instance, the value of the No. 1 overall pick is $11,075,900, a Draft record. The total value for a club's picks in those rounds equals what it can spend without incurring a penalty. If a player taken in the top 10 rounds doesn't sign, his pick's value gets subtracted from his team's pool. Clubs near the top of the Draft often spend less than the assigned value for those choices and use the savings to offer more money to later selections.

A team that exceeds its bonus pool faces a penalty. A club outspending its allotment by 0-5 percent pays a 75 percent tax on the overage. At higher thresholds, a team loses future picks: a first-rounder and a 75 percent tax for surpassing its pool by more than 5 and up to 10 percent; a first- and a second-rounder and a 100 percent tax for more than 10 and up to 15 percent; and two first-rounders and a 100 percent tax for more than 15 percent.
In 13 Drafts with bonus pool rules, clubs have outspent their allotments a total of 240 times but never by more than 5 percent. The Cardinals, Cubs, Dodgers and Giants have surpassed their pools every year, and 23 of the 30 teams did so in 2024. The Rockies and Twins have never exceeded their pools.

Selections made in the top 10 rounds have bonus-slot values assigned to each spot, leading to each club’s collective bonus pool. The overage on any bonus signed above $150,000 after the 10th round will also be applied to the pool. So the middle rounds are where teams get creative – sometimes mixing senior signs with low leverage with high-ceiling prep types who need to be signed away from major college commitments. Players taken in the top 10 rounds often sign because teams lose that slot value in their pool if they can’t complete a deal.
There will be one-minute breaks between picks through Round 10 on Monday, as well as a 10-minute break between Rounds 6 and 7. There will be no delay between selections after that, beyond a one-hour break between Rounds 10 and 11 and another 10-minute pause between Rounds 15 and 16.
Below is a running breakdown of some of the most notable picks from Day 2, along with their rank on the
MLB Pipeline Top 250 Draft rankings
