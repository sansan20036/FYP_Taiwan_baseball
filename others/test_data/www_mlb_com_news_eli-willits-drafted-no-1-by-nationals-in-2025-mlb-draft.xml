ATLANTA – The Nationals had the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 MLB Draft for the first time in 15 years, and with the coveted selection, they chose the youngest prospect in the class.
The Nats picked shortstop
Eli Willits
from Fort Cobb-Broxton High School (Okla.). At 17 years and 216 days old, Willits, the
No. 5 Draft prospect
per MLB Pipeline, is the youngest true prospect in the 2025 class after reclassifying from the class of ‘26.

On Sunday night, Willits achieved the goal he wrote down two years ago.
“Every kid’s dream is to be the No. 1 overall pick,” Willits said. “That’s just something I set my standards to. It’s what people say [about] the best pick in the Draft. If you go No. 1 overall, no one can go above you. I’m just grateful and thankful for God to put me in this situation.”

Willits is the third-youngest player in history to be drafted first overall and the youngest since Ken Griffey Jr. (17 years, 193 days) in 1987. Tim Foli, the top pick in 1968, was the youngest (17 years, 180 days).
“Eli was the top guy on our board,” said Nationals interim general manager Mike DeBartolo. “It's one of those nice things where the scouts and the analysts see things exactly the same way and saw him as the best hitter in the Draft, the best fielder in the Draft with just great makeup, great work ethic and all the intangibles.”
The Nationals shook up their front office one week before making the first overall pick in the Draft. Last Sunday, they
fired general manager Mike Rizzo and manager Dave Martinez
. DeBartolo, who had been the assistant general manager and part of the organization since 2012, was named interim GM.
DeBartolo made the joint announcement with vice president, amateur scouting Danny Haas; senior director, amateur scouting Brad Ciolek; and assistant director and national crosschecker, amateur scouting Reed Dunn.
“I would say he was our top guy throughout the process. We had our eye on him throughout,” said DeBartolo. “… He was the guy we wanted all along, and we’re really excited that it worked out so well.”
A switch-hitter who's better from the left side, Willits has a good eye and is already quite a mature hitter for his age. His bat-to-ball skills are excellent, and he's shown the ability to consistently hit line drives. Though he has some raw power, he likely would top out at 15 homers a year in the bigs.
Every No. 1 overall Draft pick in MLB history
Willits noted as “still a 17-year-old kid,” he looks forward to taking his power, and his strength and conditioning, to the next level as he develops.
“I want to be described as a guy that plays harder than everyone else,” Willits. “But at the end of the day, I want to be described as a great human being that is good to people off the field and good to teammates.”
Willits has good speed and a strong arm, and he also displays good instincts in the field -- qualities that scouts believe will only get better as he develops physically. He will likely continue as a shortstop, but he could also develop into an outfielder. Willits is said to be a more developed teenage version of Yankees shortstop Anthony Volpe.

“He makes the routine play about as easy as you can see anybody make it, much less a 17-year-old,” said Haas. “It's just very soft, sure hands; educated, quick feet in all directions; and just a very compact, accurate, strong throwing arm.”
Last season, Willits hit .473 with 14 doubles, one triple, eight home runs, 34 RBIs, 27 walks, 47 stolen bases and 56 runs scored. He struck out only four times while posting a .602 on-base percentage, .912 slugging percentage and 1.514 OPS in 128 plate appearances. Willits led his team to its sixth consecutive Oklahoma Secondary School Activities Association Class B state title.
“Eli really loves the game,” said Haas. “You can tell that he's dedicated, and he's had a lot of reps in his career.”

Willits is committed to the University of Oklahoma -- where his father, former big leaguer Reggie Willits, played and coaches, and where his older brother, Jaxon, plays now -- but he's unlikely to be a Sooner, given his high Draft stock. Through his Oklahoma connection, Willits already knows pitchers Jake Irvin, Cade Cavalli and Jake Bennett.
“It’s definitely going to be a long path. There’s a lot of development still left to do,” Willits said. “But I’m excited and happy to get to work with such a great organization and great people in the Nats organization. So I’m ready to start building relationships with my teammates, my coaches and get to work.”

Selections made in the top 10 rounds have bonus-slot values assigned to each spot, leading to each club’s collective bonus pool. The overage on any bonus signed above $150,000 after the 10th round will also be applied to the pool. So the middle rounds are where teams get creative – sometimes mixing senior signs with low leverage with high-ceiling prep types who need to be signed away from major college commitments. Players taken in the top 10 rounds often sign because teams lose that slot value in their pool if they can’t complete a deal.
There will be one-minute breaks between picks through Round 10 on Monday, as well as a 10-minute break between Rounds 6 and 7. There will be no delay between selections after that, beyond a one-hour break between Rounds 10 and 11 and another 10-minute pause between Rounds 15 and 16.
Below is a running breakdown of some of the most notable picks from Day 2, along with their rank on the
MLB Pipeline Top 250 Draft rankings
