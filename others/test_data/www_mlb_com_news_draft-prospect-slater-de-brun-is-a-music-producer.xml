This story originally ran previously, before Slater de Brun was drafted with the No. 37 pick by the Orioles.
Slater de Brun
, the
No. 24 prospect
on MLB Pipeline's Draft board, can bring a lot to a team once he's
selected on Sunday
.
The lefty's been graded at a 55 hit tool, 60 field and 65 run. His 5-foot-10 stature and excellent speed have him drawing comparisons to two-time All-Star Corbin Carroll. He told MLB Pipeline that the three words to describe his style of play are "fast, explosive and aggressive."

But there's one skill that may have been overlooked by scouts -- an off-the-field art form that Mike Piazza, Ken Griffey Jr. and
other stars showed
off during their MLB careers. It's an alter-ego he can retreat to and use it to connect with new fans in different ways.
"My nickname is Lil Slayyy," de Brun said. "For music."
Yes, de Brun is a musician/music producer who goes by Lil Slayyy. He started off by producing beats, teaching himself through YouTube tutorials. But soon after, he realized he loved singing and began putting out country singles like "Break My Heart" and "Find me a Bar" (although he reassured us that he does not like bars and does not go to bars). He also found a seamless connection between making music and playing baseball, that helped him relax in both pursuits.
"The first time they ever played my music over the school speakers, I was nervous, I didn't like hearing my voice like that," Brun said. "But it just took experience. And that's the same thing with failure in baseball. The more you fail, the easier it gets. And then, you suddenly start not to care in a good way. You kind of get over the failure faster."
You know, like striking out one day in the ninth inning and then blasting a walk-off, three-run homer the next.
The center fielder has also found that his music can help bring people together -- an important skill in a team sport.
"Making music and singing is pretty vulnerable," de Brun told us. "That's helped people connect with me. They call me Lil Slayyy, they know that I'm doing something unique, so they get to know me on a more personal level. That's helped me with my friendships and with getting team chemistry."
Teammates and others his age in the baseball world will even
jam out
to his songs
on social media
. A platform where he's gone semi-viral for
a Tik-Tok trend with his girlfriend
, and recent UNC soccer commit, Eres Freifeld. There's also videos like ... whatever this is?
It's all part of a fun, energetic, goofy (he says he'd love for Zach Galifianakis to play him in a movie) package that is unique in this Draft. And careful: If you're a team that has a chance to pick him, and you don't, he might write a song about you.

Selections made in the top 10 rounds have bonus-slot values assigned to each spot, leading to each club’s collective bonus pool. The overage on any bonus signed above $150,000 after the 10th round will also be applied to the pool. So the middle rounds are where teams get creative – sometimes mixing senior signs with low leverage with high-ceiling prep types who need to be signed away from major college commitments. Players taken in the top 10 rounds often sign because teams lose that slot value in their pool if they can’t complete a deal.
There will be one-minute breaks between picks through Round 10 on Monday, as well as a 10-minute break between Rounds 6 and 7. There will be no delay between selections after that, beyond a one-hour break between Rounds 10 and 11 and another 10-minute pause between Rounds 15 and 16.
Below is a running breakdown of some of the most notable picks from Day 2, along with their rank on the
MLB Pipeline Top 250 Draft rankings
where applicable:
