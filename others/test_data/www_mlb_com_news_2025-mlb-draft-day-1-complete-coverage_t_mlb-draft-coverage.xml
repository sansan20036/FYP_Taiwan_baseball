ATLANTA -- Day 1 of the 2025 Draft is in the books, as clubs made the first 105 selections on Sunday night, covering Rounds 1, 2 and 3, Competitive Balance Rounds A and B, plus two compensation picks.
It was an unforgettable night for every player selected, but a few storylines stood out. We saw a trio of prospects taken from Corona High School in Southern California, as well as the selection of the
twin Witherspoon brothers
and
Lodise cousins
. There were also
a few draftees with family ties
to former big leaguers, and a total of eight Tennessee Volunteers heard their name called on Day 1.

Day 2 (Rounds 4-20) begins at 11:30 a.m. ET on Monday and will stream live exclusively on MLB.com.
Below is every pick from Day 1, as well as analysis for the first 43 picks and other notable selections from Round 2 and beyond.
Round 1
1. Nationals: Eli Willits, SS, Fort Cobb-Broxton HS, Fort Cobb, Okla. (
Ranked No. 5 by MLB Pipeline
)
As the clock was ticking on Sunday, there was a lot of buzz that Willits -- at 17 years, 216 days old the third-youngest player in history to be drafted first overall, and the youngest since Ken Griffey Jr. in 1987 -- was gaining a lot more traction in Nationals’ room. The son of former big leaguer Reggie Willits, Eli has a ton of upside, with some scouts thinking he could very well be the best player in this class when we look back at it. He has a high baseball IQ, can stick at shortstop and can go run and get it in center field if need be. The Nats will save considerable money against the $11,075,900 slot value for the top pick.

2. Angels: Tyler Bremner, RHP, UC Santa Barbara (
No. 18
)
The Angels are always willing to forge their own path in looking for talent that can get to the big leagues in a hurry. Bremner has premium stuff, with a fastball up to 98 mph and one of the better changeups in the class to go along with a slider. This will be another below-slot deal, but Bremner finished the 2025 season as one of the hottest college pitchers in the game, with several double-digit-strikeout performances down the stretch.
More »
3. Mariners: Kade Anderson, LHP, Louisiana State (
No. 2
)
The Mariners certainly have had success in developing pitching, especially starting arms out of college (See Gilbert, Logan; Kirby, George as former first-rounders). Anderson is the most advanced arm in the class and could be a part of a big league rotation as early as next season. The lefty starred in the College World Series and clearly doesn’t shy away from the spotlight.
More »
4. Rockies: Ethan Holliday, SS/3B, Stillwater (Okla.) HS (
No. 1
)
Matt’s kid goes to play for his dad’s old team. Seems fitting, no? Jackson’s brother has been atop our board (based on talent) since last December and still could be the most dynamic player from the class. This seemed to be the floor all along for Holliday, and now he can develop his tremendous offensive ceiling, which includes ridiculous raw power, while playing on the left side of the infield for the Rockies.
More »
5. Cardinals: Liam Doyle, LHP, Tennessee (
No. 8
)
One of the most dominant pitchers on the college scene this year while doing it in the ultra-competitive SEC, Doyle becomes the second of the college southpaws to come off the board. He does it with a bit of an unorthodox delivery and four pitches that are at least above average, helping him to lead all D-I pitchers in strikeout rate (15.4 per nine innings) in his third school in three years.
More »
6. Pirates: Seth Hernandez, RHP, Corona (Calif.) HS (
No. 3
)
A year ago, the Pirates had the opportunity to take the top high school hitter on the board, and they did so by taking Konnor Griffin, now one of the game’s best prospects. This time, with the best prep arm on the board, they capitalized by taking Hernandez. He has a fastball that touches the upper 90s, a plus-plus changeup and feel to spin. He’s more advanced than your typical high school right-hander, helping offset the risk often associated with the demographic.

7. Marlins: Aiva Arquette, SS, Oregon State (
No. 6
)
The Marlins haven’t had as much success developing bats as they have with arms. Hopefully Arquette, the top college hitter in this class after posting an OPS of 1.115 for the Beavers, can change that, providing an offensive lift as an infielder with a chance to stick at shortstop.
More »
8. Blue Jays: JoJo Parker, SS, Purvis (Miss.) HS (
No. 9
)
The buzz around this pick was that the Jays were weighing college arms or high school shortstops, and the latter category won the day. Parker has the chance to be a plus hitter with 20- to 25-homer power, and while he can certainly be sent out as a shortstop, he could end up at second or third, with more than enough bat to profile there. I’m curious to see if Toronto drafts
JoJo’s twin brother, Jacob
, later in the Draft.
More »
9. Reds: Steele Hall, SS, Hewitt-Trussville HS, Trussville, Ala. (
No. 12
)
It’s long been known that high school shortstops are the strength of this class, and we’re seeing a mini-run on them right now. Like Willits, Hall reclassified to be a part of this Draft and is still only 17. He’s one of the fastest players in the Draft -- some scouts give him 80-grade speed on the 20-to-80 scouting scale -- and he could be a plus defender at shortstop, too. He’s aggressive at the plate, but there’s plenty of offensive upside.
More »
10. White Sox: Billy Carlson, SS, Corona (Calif.) HS (
No. 7
)
This gives Corona High School in California the distinction of being the first high school to have two top-10 picks in the same Draft, with Hernandez and now Carlson. Some scouts felt that Carlson was the best defender in this class, and one of the better defensive shortstops some area scouts had ever seen in Southern California. There’s plenty of bat speed from the right side, and he should grow into more impact as he matures.
More »
11. Athletics: Jamie Arnold, LHP, Florida State (
No. 4
)
The A’s have to be pretty happy that Arnold, at one point considered to be in contention to be the No. 1 pick in the Draft, was still on the board here, and I’m pretty sure they didn’t expect it. Recent first-rounders Jacob Wilson and Nick Kurtz made it to the big leagues in a hurry, and it shouldn’t take Arnold too long to join them on the mound as a lefty with a strong résumé of college success.
More »
12. Rangers: Gavin Fien, 3B, Great Oak HS, Temecula, Calif. (
No. 22
)
It’s always been bats mentioned here; it was just a question of which one. The Rangers opted for Fien, who was considered the best pure high school hitter on the summer showcase circuit. He wasn’t as consistently on time this spring, but there’s plenty of bat speed and future power to profile well at the hot corner at the next level. It’s the third straight year Texas went with a bat with its first selection, though the previous two were college hitters.
More »
13. Giants: Gavin Kilen, 2B/SS, Tennessee (
No. 21
)
It’s a run on Gavins! After two years at Louisville, Kilen moved to Tennessee and had a big year (1.112 OPS). He’s played shortstop in the past, but he profiles better as a second baseman. He makes a ton of contact from the left side and has a chance to be an outstanding hitter with some pop, though he can be a bit too aggressive at the plate.
More »
14. Rays: Daniel Pierce, SS, Mill Creek HS, Hoschton, Ga. (
No. 13
)
That’s seven high school infielders taken in the top 14 picks if you’re scoring at home. Pierce is an advanced right-handed hitter who has shown no problems against premium pitching. He’s a plus runner who can stick at short as well. It’s the second year in a row the Rays have taken a high schooler with their top pick, and last year’s first-rounder, Theo Gillen, has performed well in his first full season.
More »
15. Red Sox: Kyson Witherspoon, RHP, Oklahoma (
No. 10
)
Witherspoon is the top college right-hander in the class, and his name had come up in the top 10 in the weeks leading up to the Draft. He’s super athletic on the mound, with four plus pitches and solid control coming from a compact arm action. He’s also the
second twin to be taken
(JoJo Parker
being the other one
); his brother Malachi was taken by Detroit with the 62nd overall pick. This is the first time Boston has taken an arm with its first pick since Tanner Houck in 2017.
More »
16. Twins: Marek Houston, SS, Wake Forest (
No. 15
)
Of all the potential first-round picks from the college shortstop crop, Houston is the one who is most definitely going to play the premium position at the highest level. He’s a plus defender with excellent actions and arm strength. His glove is ahead of his bat, but he’s added some strength and could have some impact at the plate. The Twins have taken a hitter with their first pick in the last four Drafts now, three of them hailing from the college ranks.
More »
17. Cubs: Ethan Conrad, OF, Wake Forest (
No. 28
)
Back-to-back Demon Deacons taken! Conrad could have gone even higher if he hadn’t hurt his throwing shoulder diving for a ball early in the year, an injury that necessitated surgery. He’s an aggressive swinger, but he has a knack for loud contact and could have at least average power in the future. He could be given a chance to play center field at the next level, too. This is three straight college hitters in the first round for the Cubs.
More »
18. Diamondbacks: Kayson Cunningham, SS/2B, Johnson HS, San Antonio (
No. 14
)
The D-backs are certainly not afraid of undersized left-handed high school hitters who can rake, with Corbin Carroll and Slade Caldwell as recent outfield examples. Cunningham is a middle infielder with incredible barrel control; he rarely swings and misses and has a chance to grow into solid pop for a 5-foot-10 hitter. He plays with infectious energy and could start out as a shortstop, though many think he’ll end up at second base.
More »
19. Orioles: Ike Irish, OF/C, Auburn (
No. 11
)
After a lot of rumors that he was going to go in the top 10 in a deal, Irish lands with a team that knows a thing or two about drafting and developing hitters. Irish improved as an overall hitter with Auburn this year and could be a plus hitter at the next level with 20- to 25-homer power. He was announced as a catcher and could develop behind the dish, but some think his bat could carry him more quickly if he plays the outfield.
More »
20. Brewers: Andrew Fischer, 1B/3B, Tennessee (
No. 29
)
I don’t want to say the Brewers have a type, but … they picked Blake Burke and Brock Wilken in the last two Drafts and have some serious depth at corner-infield spots. But Fischer can really, really rake, with plus power to all fields, and he became even more dangerous when he toned down his swing this year with the Volunteers.
More »
21. Astros: Xavier Neyens, SS/3B, Mount Vernon (Wash.) HS (
No. 25
)
It’s possible we’ll look back at this first round and realize that the Astros got the best power hitter in the class. At times, Neyens has looked like an elite hitter who’d easily get to that pop, and at times the swing-and-miss tendencies concerned scouts, which is why he didn’t end up closer to the top of the first round. He was announced as a shortstop, but his size (6-foot-4) and his arm will profile best at third base.
More »
22. Braves: Tate Southisene, SS/OF, Basic HS, Las Vegas (
No. 39
)
Tate’s older brother, Ty, was a fourth-rounder of the Cubs last year who signed an over-slot deal. Tate is bigger and more physical than his brother, a reason why he bested his bro by a few rounds. He has great bat control with good contact skills despite taking aggressive hacks that will help him get to some power. He’s a plus runner who can stick at shortstop.
More »
23. Royals: Sean Gamble, 2B/OF, IMG Academy, Bradenton, Fla. (
No. 27
)
There was SO much talk about how scouting director Brian Bridges loves high school pitching that it seemed too easy to project lefty Kruz Schoolcraft here (I did it anyway). But he did take Jac Caglianone last year, and the organization took hitters first in the two Drafts before that. Gamble gives off Bryson Stott vibes and has the chance to be a very good hitter with good speed. He’s been very good defensively at second base and in center field, and he was announced as an outfielder.
More »
24. Tigers: Jordan Yost, SS, Sickles (Fla.) HS (
No. 50
)
This might seem like a bit of a reach, but we (Jim Callis specifically) had been hearing about Yost climbing Draft boards as we got closer, and he was among the names we mentioned as generating Draft buzz on Saturday. Yost is a left-handed-hitting high schooler with a chance to stick at short and fits in the mold of recent Tigers draftees like Max Clark, Kevin McGonigle and Bryce Rainer.
More »
25. Padres: Kruz Schoolcraft, LHP, Sunset (Ore.) HS (
No. 19
)
There are few certainties in life: Death, taxes and the Padres taking a high school player with their first pick. This makes nine straight for San Diego, which gets the best high school lefty in the class. Schoolcraft has huge upside with a 6-foot-8 frame with two plus pitches and an above-average changeup to boot. He was a talented two-way guy with tremendous power at the plate as well.
More »
26. Phillies: Gage Wood, RHP, Arkansas (
No. 23
)
It’s unclear how much the College World Series enters into evaluations now that the Draft is after its conclusion, but there’s no question Wood helped his stock with his thrilling no-hitter in Omaha. Wood has an unhittable fastball and a power curve as his two best offerings. The Phillies went back to pitching in the first round for the first time since taking Andrew Painter in 2021.
More »
27. Guardians: Jace LaViolette, OF, Texas A&amp;M (
No. 20
)
We could look back at this pick and realize the Guardians got a steal … if they can get LaViolette straightened out. Once thought to be a contender for the No. 1 pick, LaViolette really hampered his production with his swing-and-miss issues, though there’s still raw power to spare and speed, giving him a chance to play center.
More »
Prospect Promotion Incentive Pick
28. Royals: Josh Hammond, 3B, Wesleyan Christian Academy, High Point, N.C. (
No. 26
)
Hammond was a talented two-way guy that some teams initially preferred on the mound. He wanted to hit, then went out and proved he belonged there, representing one of the better prep left-handed power bats in the class.
Compensation picks
29. Diamondbacks: Patrick Forbes, RHP, Louisville (
No. 31
)
After getting their high school hitter with their first pick, the D-backs went the college pitching route with their second selection. Forbes is a former two-way guy who was more of a hitter to start, so he has a fresher arm and took off this year, ranking third among D-I hitters with 14.8 strikeouts per nine, starting with a fastball that touches triple digits.
30. Orioles: Caden Bodine, C, Coastal Carolina (
No. 32
)
With the
biggest bonus pool in this year’s Draft
, the Orioles have no shortage of options. They’ve gone with college bats for their first two picks, making you wonder when they might start rolling the dice with over-slot high school guys.
31. Orioles: Wehiwa Aloy, SS, Arkansas (
No. 17
)
Make that three college hitters. Aloy, who won the Golden Spikes Award with a huge year for the Razorbacks, has impressive power, especially for a guy who should be able to stick at short.
32: Brewers: Brady Ebel, SS, Corona (Calif.) HS (
No. 64
)
That’s three Corona High School products taken tonight. The son of Dodgers third-base coach Dino Ebel, Brady looked like he had the chance to go in the first round like Hernandez and Carlson, but he doesn’t have as much impact at the plate. He has the chance to be a decent hitter and has a high baseball IQ, and could even get a chance to play short after playing third in deference to Carlson at Corona.
Competitive Balance Round A
33. Red Sox: Marcus Phillips, RHP, Tennessee (
No. 61
)
Phillips can hit triple digits with his fastball and has solid secondaries with his slider and changeup. He has a Kumar Rocker-like build but is more athletic, a former two-way guy who had some thump at the plate.
34. Tigers: Michael Oliveto, C, Hauppauge (N.Y.) HS (
No. 219
)
Whoa. Area scouts in the Northeast had told me they were hearing buzz about Oliveto going in the second round … and this beats that by quite a bit. He’s a left-handed hitter who has some pop, and the Tigers hope he can follow in the footsteps of former Long Island prep backstop Logan O’Hoppe.
35. Mariners: Luke Stevenson, C, North Carolina (
No. 33
)
Stevenson was the second-best college catcher in the class, after Bodine. He has excellent catch-and-throw skills to go along with legit raw power to all fields, but it’s power over hit for him at this point.
36. Twins: Riley Quick, RHP, Alabama (
No. 38
)
After taking a college bat with their first pick, the Twins opt for a college arm here. Quick has a first-round-caliber fastball and slider, and he’ll flash a decent changeup, though he’ll need to refine his command to be a starter. Still, it should be noted the Twins do well in developing arms.
37. Orioles: Slater de Brun, OF, Summit (Ore.) HS (
No. 24
)
Now we see the Orioles going the high school route, with de Brun giving off Corbin Carroll vibes as an undersized left-handed-hitting outfielder from the Pacific Northwest. He’s actually more physical than Carroll was at this stage.
38. Mets: Mitch Voit, 2B/RHP, Michigan (
No. 63
)
This is the Mets’ first selection in the Draft, and it’s interesting to see Voit announced as a two-way player. He hasn’t pitched since 2024 after undergoing internal brace surgery on his right elbow, but he had a big year while focusing on hitting in 2025, with an OPS over 1.100, thanks to a better approach and swing decisions.
More &gt;&gt;
39. Yankees: Dax Kilby, SS, Newman (Ga.) HS (
No. 62
)
The Yankees went the high school shortstop route with their first pick, and they do like their bats when they can get them. Kilby is a left-handed-hitting shortstop with a compact swing that creates consistent contact, and his 6-foot-2 frame points to more future power. He’ll get a look at shortstop, but some scouts think he’ll end up at second or left field.
More &gt;&gt;
40. Dodgers: Zachary Root, LHP, Arkansas (
No. 42
)
Root is more about his secondary pitches than his fastball, though his heater can top 97 mph, with good sink. His changeup is outstanding and he misses a lot of bats with his curve, while employing an excellent cutter as well. He might not have the highest ceiling in the world, but he has a high floor as a No. 4-type big league starter.
More &gt;&gt;
41. Dodgers: Charles Davalan, OF, Arkansas (
No. 54
)
Wow, the Dodgers must love Fayetteville, huh? Or maybe it’s the SEC. Davalan transferred from Florida Gulf Coast, and he reminds some of Mets prospect Drew Gilbert. His value would be maximized if he can play center field or get a look at second base, where he’s played before.
42. Rays: Brendan Summerhill, OF, Arizona (
No. 16
)
Summerhill has first-round tools and has shown them off, though missing time with a broken hand this spring didn’t help his stock at all. Some see a little Jake McCarthy in him, and he’d profile better, with less pressure to get to his power, if he can show that he can stick in center.
43. Marlins: Cam Cannarella, OF, Clemson (
No. 36
)
The comp round ends with a string of college outfielders, and the Marlins have back-to-back college bats. A shoulder injury has hampered Cannarella some, but he’s shown an impressive hit-over-power profile with plus speed that he can use on the basepaths once he’s fully healthy.
Round 2
44. White Sox: Jaden Fauske, OF, Nazareth Academy (Ill.)
45. Rockies: JB Middleton, RHP, Southern Mississippi
46. Marlins: Brandon Compton, OF, Arizona State
47. Angels: Chase Shores, RHP, Louisiana State
48. Athletics: Devin Taylor, OF, Indiana
The A’s didn’t think they’d get Jamie Arnold in the first round, and I bet they figured Taylor, one of the better all-around hitters from the college bat set, wouldn’t be here in Round 2.
49. Nationals: Ethan Petry, OF, South Carolina
50. Pirates: Angel Cervantes, RHP, Warren (Calif.) HS
Back-to-back high school right-handers for the Pirates, first Hernandez, then Cervantes, who offers projection and similar polish for a high schooler. Big night for Pirates SoCal-area scout Mark Sluys!
51. Reds: Aaron Watson, RHP, Trinity Christian Academy (Fla.)
The Reds don’t shy away from high school talent, and they dipped into it twice in the early going, getting Hall on the dirt and then Watson, with his good feel for pitching and projection in his 6-foot-5 frame.
52. Rangers: AJ Russell, RHP, Tennessee
If he comes all the way back from internal brace surgery, the Rangers will have essentially taken a first-rounder here in Russell, who could have an 80 fastball, a plus slider and solid command.
53. Rays: Cooper Flemming, SS, Aliso Niguel (Calif.) HS
54. Twins: Quentin Young, SS, Oaks Christian School (Calif.)
One of the most physical players in the class, Young is Dmitri and Delmon’s nephew. He has ridiculous raw power, albeit with swing-and-miss concerns, and he’s a tremendous athlete, especially for his size.
55. Cardinals: Ryan Mitchell, OF, Houston (Tenn.) HS
56. Cubs: Kane Kepley, OF, North Carolina
57. Mariners: Nick Becker, SS, Don Bosco Prep (N.J.)
58. Orioles: Joseph Dzierwa, LHP, Michigan State
59. Brewers: J.D. Thompson, LHP, Vanderbilt
60. Braves: Alex Lodise, SS, Florida State
61. Royals: Michael Lombardi, RHP, Tulane
62. Tigers: Malachi Witherspoon, RHP, Oklahoma
The
other
Witherspoon twin is off the board! Kyson went in the first round to the Red Sox, and now his brother is off the board. Malachi was actually the better prospect coming out of high school, so there’s some projection and upside the Tigers can try to tap into here.
63. Phillies: Cade Obermueller, LHP, Iowa
64. Guardians: Dean Curley, SS, Tennessee
65. Dodgers: Cam Leiter, RHP, Florida State
The Dodgers are not afraid of taking injured arms and getting them back on the mound. Leiter, Al and Mark’s nephew, had first-round upside but didn’t throw a competitive pitch in 2025 because of shoulder issues.
Competitive Balance Round B
66. Guardians: Aaron Walton, OF, Arizona
67. Rays: Dean Moss, OF, IMG Academy (Fla.)
68. Brewers: Frank Cairone, LHP, Delsea Regional HS (N.J.)
69. Orioles: JT Quinn, RHP, Georgia
70. Guardians: Will Hynes, RHP, Lorne Park Secondary School (Ontario, Canada)
71. Royals: Justin Lamkin, LHP, Texas A&amp;M
72. Cardinals: Tanner Franklin, RHP, Tennessee
73. Pirates: Murf Gray, 3B, Fresno State
74. Rockies: Max Belyeu, OF, Texas
Compensation pick
75. Red Sox: Henry Godbout, SS, Virginia
Round 3
76. White Sox: Kyle Lodise, SS, Georgia Tech
77. Rockies: Ethan Hedges, 3B, Southern California
78. Marlins: Max Williams, OF, Florida State
79. Angels: Johnny Slawinski, LHP, Lyndon B. Johnson HS (Texas)
80. Nationals: Landon Harmon, RHP, East Union Attendance Center (Miss.)
In past Drafts, the third round started on Day 2 and there would be a good number of high school over-slot-type guys after teams had the time to figure out their bonus pools. I wasn’t sure if it would get kicked until Round 4 because of the new schedule, but the Nationals didn’t wait. This could be another Travis Sykora-type pick for the Nats, with Harmon having an exciting fastball and slider as well as a feel for pitching.
81. Blue Jays: Jake Cook, OF, Southern Mississippi
82. Pirates: Easton Carmichael, C, Oklahoma
83. Reds: Mason Morris, RHP, Mississippi
84. Rangers: Josh Owens, SS/RHP, Providence Academy (Tenn.)
85. Giants: Trevor Cohen, OF, Rutgers
86. Rays: Taitn Gray, C, Dallas Center-Grimes (Iowa)
87. Red Sox: Anthony Eyanson, RHP, Louisiana State
The Red Sox have gone hard after college pitching and have done well to get three arms whose names were all mentioned as picks that could have gone in the top 43 picks. Eyanson has mid-rotation upside.
88. Twins: James Ellwanger, RHP, Dallas Baptist
89. Cardinals: Jack Gurevitch, 1B, San Diego
90. Cubs: Dominick Reid, RHP, Abilene Christian
91. Mariners: Griffin Hugus, RHP, Miami
92. Diamondbacks: Brian Curley, RHP, Georgia
93. Orioles: RJ Austin, OF, Vanderbilt
94. Brewers: Jacob Morrison, RHP, Coastal Carolina
95. Astros: Ethan Frey, OF, Louisiana State
96. Braves: Cody Miller, SS, East Tennessee State
97. Royals: Cameron Millar, RHP, Alhambra (Calif.) HS
98. Tigers: Ben Jacobs, LHP, Arizona State
99. Padres: Ryan Wideman, OF, Western Kentucky
Born in Spain because his father, Tom, was playing professional basketball there, Wideman has tremendous tools and physicality with plus raw power and double-plus speed, though he’ll need an approach adjustment. He was the first Division I hitter with 35 extra-base hits and 45 steals in a season since 2001.

Selections made in the top 10 rounds have bonus-slot values assigned to each spot, leading to each club’s collective bonus pool. The overage on any bonus signed above $150,000 after the 10th round will also be applied to the pool. So the middle rounds are where teams get creative – sometimes mixing senior signs with low leverage with high-ceiling prep types who need to be signed away from major college commitments. Players taken in the top 10 rounds often sign because teams lose that slot value in their pool if they can’t complete a deal.
There will be one-minute breaks between picks through Round 10 on Monday, as well as a 10-minute break between Rounds 6 and 7. There will be no delay between selections after that, beyond a one-hour break between Rounds 10 and 11 and another 10-minute pause between Rounds 15 and 16.
Below is a running breakdown of some of the most notable picks from Day 2, along with their rank on the
MLB Pipeline Top 250 Draft rankings
