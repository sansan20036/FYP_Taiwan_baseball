Surprise picks, famous families headline Day 1 of Draft
The first two picks of the Draft defied nearly every mock, but fittingly Ethan Holliday went to Colorado, where his father Matt starred for years. Plus, the Red Sox reeled off their 10th win a row and Kyle Stowers hit THREE homers off his former club.
He's an All-Star now -- and the team that traded him knows why
Traded last year by the Orioles, Kyle Stowers returned to Baltimore this past weekend as a newly minted All-Star. And just for good measure, the Marlins slugger went OFF on Sunday with 3 homers among his 5 hits, plus 6 RBIs.

500-foot homers are incredible. But how about a 500-mile HR?
Monday's T-Mobile Home Run Derby will bring out MLB's top sluggers. But none of them will come close to the longest homer in Atlanta history from way back in 1954.

Left-handed Draft prospect Jack Bauer (that's right, he was named after the iconic terrorist-thwarting character from "24") has been soaring up boards because of his eye-popping velocity.
